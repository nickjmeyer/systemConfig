** Brightness
   Adjusting the brightness with ~xbacklight~ does not work using
   integrated graphics.  Create the file
   ~/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-intel.conf~ with the following
   content.
   #+BEGIN_SRC
   Section "Device"
       Identifier  "card0"
       Driver      "intel"
       Option      "Backlight"  "intel_backlight"
       BusID       "PCI:0:2:0"
   EndSection
   #+END_SRC
